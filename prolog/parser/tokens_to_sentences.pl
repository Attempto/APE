/** <module> APE Sentence splitter

Converts a flat list of tokens into a list of sentences,
each of which is a list of tokens. Sentences end with
one of the three symbols: '.', '?', and '!'.

For example, the following list of tokens:

==
[John, likes, Mary, ., Every, man, owns, a, car, .]
==

is converted into the following list of sentences

==
[[John, likes, Mary, .], [Every, man, owns, a, car, .]]
==

@bug should we generate error messages here (if token list does not end with ./?/!)
