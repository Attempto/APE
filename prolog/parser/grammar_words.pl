/** <module> Word-level Grammar Rules

This module contains word-level grammar rules. It manages the fact that certain words can be
capitalized at the beginning of a sentence. Furthermore, it keeps track of the parsing process
and, in the case of an error, it can determine up to which token parsing succeeded.

%% word(?Word)
%
% This rule reads the token Word which can be in sentence-initial position.

word(Word) -->
    [Word],
    record_position.

word(Word) -->
    [^, Word],
    record_position.


%% word(?Word, +Condition)
%
% This rule reads the token Word (which can be in sentence-initial position) if the given condition
% is fulfilled.

word(Word, Condition) -->
    [Word],
    { call(Condition) },
    record_position.

word(Word, Condition) -->
	[^, Word],

%
% This rule reads the token Word in sentence-initial position.

word_initial(Word) -->
	[^, Word],
    record_position.


%% word_initial(?Word, +Condition)
%
% This rule reads the token Word in sentence-initial position if the given condition is fulfilled.

word_initial(Word, Condition) -->
	[^, Word],
    { call(Condition) },
    record_position.


%% word_noninitial(?Word)
%
% This rule reads the token Word if it is not in sentence-initial position.

word_noninitial(Word) -->
	[Word],
    record_position.


%% word_noninitial(?Word, +Condition)
%
% This rule reads the token Word if it is not in sentence-initial position and if the given condition
% is fulfilled.

word_noninitial(Word, Condition) -->
	[Word],

%% word_capitalize(+Word, +WordInitial)
%
% This rule reads the token Word. In sentence-initial position also WordInitial is accepted.

word_capitalize(Word, _WordInitial) -->
    [Word],
    record_position.

word_capitalize(Word, _WordInitial) -->
	[^, Word],
    record_position.

word_capitalize(_Word, WordInitial) -->

%
% This rule reads the tokens of WordList which can be in sentence-initial position.

% This rule reads the tokens of WordList if they are in sentence-initial position and if the
% condition is fulfilled.

words_initial(WordList, Condition) -->
    [^],

% This rule reads the tokens of WordList if they are not in sentence-initial position.

words_noninitial([]) -->
	record_position.

words_noninitial([Word|Rest]) -->
    [Word],

%
% This predicate can be used as a DCG rule. It reads no token but asserts a warning message.

% or warning message is asserted. In the case of an error, the complete predicate fails.

%% tokencount(-TokenCount)
%
% This predicate stores the overall number of tokens.

:- dynamic tokencount/1.

%
% This predicate stores the positions in a backwards way, i.e. the number of tokens that are not (yet) parsed.

:- dynamic position_backwards/1.


%% get_position(-Position)
%
% This predicate can be used as a DCG rule. It reads no token but returns the position in a forward
% way, i.e. starting from the beginning of the list.

get_position(Position, [^|Tokens], [^|Tokens]) :-
	!,
	length(Tokens, Length),
	tokencount(TokenCount),
	Position is TokenCount - Length.

	!,
	length(Tokens, Length),
	tokencount(TokenCount),

%
% This predicate can be used as a DCG rule. Is reads nothing, but records the position.

record_position(List, List) :-
    length(List, Length),
    record_position(Length).


%% record_position(+Pos)
%
% This predicates records the position Pos (which is the number of unparsed tokens) if it is not
% already recorded.

record_position(Pos) :-
    position_backwards(Pos),
    !.

record_position(Pos) :-
    assert(position_backwards(Pos)).


%% get_minimum(+List, +TempMin, -Min)
%
% Returns the minimal value of the list or TempMin, whichever is smaller.

get_minimum([], M, M).
